# Simple-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-MLP-Neural-Network
A basic Python implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network using sigmoid activation. The networkâ€™s structure is configurable, allowing for customized layers, neurons, and inputs. This is a simple demonstration of forward propagation.
